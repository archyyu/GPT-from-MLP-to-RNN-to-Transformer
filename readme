this is a repo with a series of model to generate text
from base MLP to RNN, to GRU to LSTM, maybe in the future I will add attentoin

I add this repo because I want to further my study at Deeplearning.
if everything goes smooth, I will pursue a phd position.

wish me best


right now, I have added the transformer model to generate new characters.

only issue with this repo is that, I added an deep rnn, but the performance of 
that model is not good. 
I finnally found it is the first time I try to train a deep neural networks, 
there should be some tricks

Will continue that process.
